          <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            The story of Durga is the story of victory over evil. This story begins with a simple shapeshifting water buffalo demon named Mahishasura. The word mahisha comes from the Sanskrit for buffalo, and asura means demon. Mahishasura single-mindedly dreamt of power, and to accomplish his goal he prayed to the God, Brahma. Brahma existed as a non-gendered creator, the spring from which humanity, the earth, and even the individual gods of Hindu mythos came forth. To this God Mahishasura prayed for millions of billions of years, drinking and eating nothing but air around him. In response to his severe penance, Brahma appeared before Mahishasura, and asked for what reason he was praying so fervently. To this, Mahishasura responded plainly, "I wish to be invincible so that I may take over the world. I wish to be the most powerful of all creatures ever created. In fact, I wish that I cannot be killed by any man, animal, or God." Brahma felt apprehensive, but they no choice but to respect Mahishasura's powerful devotion and grant his request. Mahishasura immediately began his conquest of all the realms of existence.

          <p class="lead">
            Empowered by his wish, no one could stop his conquests. Human kingdom after kingdom fell to his demon legions' assault until he owned every inch of the earth, and threatened the realm of the gods. Mahishasura then challenged and conquered the gods, or Devas, themselves. Defeated and afraid, the Devas in their might were powerless in the face of his gift from Brahma. Even their fiercest of warriors fell, and the gods of Destruction themselves found themselves retreating. The Devas turned to their only option, and disappeared to pray for an eon themselves. So began a dark age of demon occupation.

          <p class="lead">
            After millions of billions of years, Brahma appeared to the Devas. The gods pleaded to their God to come to their aid, as they had no warrior that could defeat the buffalo demon. As an answer to their desperate prayers, Brahma reincarnated themself as a great warrior to defeat Mahishasura even through his gift of invincibility. As the blinding flash of light and groundshattering explosion cleared, the Devas could clearly see who stood before them. Clothed in the finest silks and adorned with the purest gold, a powerful female warrior with eight arms stood imposing before them. Mahishasura's boon did specifically designate that only any "man, animal, or god" could not defeat him. With a terrifying and fierce aura surrounding her presence, she existed for only one purpose: the utter destruction of evil.

            Awed by her presence, the Devas gifted her ten weapons to aid her in her struggle. The Lord of Destruction, Shiva, gifted her the trident, representing three qualities in humanity: Sattva (purity), Rajas (activity), Tamas (darkness). The Lords of Sun and Wind, Surya and Vayu, gifted her the bow and arrow to represent the intense energy she harnessed. The Lord of the Sky, Varuna, gifted her the conch shell to represent the sound of creation and destruction: Om. The Lord of Creation, Brahma, gifted her the lotus to signify humility in victory. The Lord of Protection, Vishnu, gifted her the chakram: a small spinning disk that represented the entirety of the universe at her command. The Lord of Time, Kala, gifted her a sword that represented the art of knowing how to divide right from wrong. The Divine Architect, Vishvakarman, gifted her an axe to represent no fear in confronting evil. The God of Fire, Agni, gifted her a spear to represent humanity's innate power to overcome obstacles. The Lord of the Devas, Indra, gifted her a thunderbolt to stay utterly focused when decimating her enemies with the wrath of a thunderstorm.

          <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Armed to the teeth and astride her steed, an enormous lion, Durga set off towards the demon's palace in the realm of the gods. Mahishasura, having spies all over the known realms, immediately spotted her ominous approach. Immediately struck by her beautiful and fierce presence, he became deeply infatuated with Durga. She rode onwards towards his castle majestically on her lion's back, defeating legions of demons in her way with complete ease. Mahishasura couldn't tear his eyes from her beautiful face though, gentle and patient. Yet underneath his misplaced love he could feel nothing but the most powerful dread. He released all of his armies on her, yet she slayed demon after demon as they appeared. Even the closest generals of Mahishasura fell to her, until none stood between Durga and her prey. Smashing down the enormous castle doors, Durga finally faced Mahishasura on his corrupted throne. "Finally!" Mahishasura exclaimed, "You have come to see me, my love! Shall we rule the earth together?" Without skipping a beat, Durga lept from her lion and crushed him underfoot. Having vanquished the evil from the world, she turned to the Devas who had come to retake their rightful places in heaven. They sang her praises, and exclaimed as one, "Oh great Devi, you have brought an end to the evil which tormented the land for eons. You are our mother, our protector, and our one true savior." She looked back on them and smiled. "Go in peace my children, you have my blessings now and forever." With that final word, Durga vanished and the Devas gave her another honorary name befitting her deeds, Mahishasuramardini, or the One Who Crushed Mahishasura. The humans on the earth below who saw her great feats celebrated her as the Goddess of Destruction and Victory Over Evil in the great yearly celebration of Navaratri.
